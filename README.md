CalculatorApp
Version 1.0
October 18, 2025

Description: A java-based multi-tool calculator program with a GUI interface. 

Instructions: This program set runs off the primary file named MenuManu.java. Download the five files as a set and place them in the same folder. Then, compile and execute. In terminal, go to the folder in your system where the files are saved, and do the following:
  type javac and all filenames.java to compile
  then type java MainManu
The program should execute and you will see a GUI window appear in the center of your screen. You can move it whereever and run the tool as needed with a return button in each window back to the manu menu. Then just hit quit to end the program.

This is an initial working build. I have plans to add more calculators and measurement tools to the menu, probably at least 10-15 items at most. The goal is to have a quickly accessible simple calculation tool ready to go for those who otherwise have to bounce back and forth between calculator programs and get annoyed running multiple apps to get what they need. 

I'm always open to suggestions. Reach me at my contact with an email header of CalculatorApp: message title etc.

Thanks for trying it!
